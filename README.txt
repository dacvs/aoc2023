Advent of Code 2023

I competed with 17 other participants on a private leaderboard of
Advent of Code 2023. I entered the contest a couple weeks late,
and I missed out on the opportunity to gain some early points.

On March 31, 2024, I was first on our leaderboard to solve all 50
problems, with 660 points. I was first to finish, but only second
place in points when I finished.

Here are my solutions, cleaned up, straightened out, and edited for
consistency. I used Python only.

Occasionally I experimented with other tools, including SymPy and
Sage Mathematics, before I switched back to Python.

It turns out that the only library I really needed was NumPy.
In places where I used other libraries (`import sys`, `import math`,
`import random`), I have edited my solutions to use NumPy only.

TODO verify the NumPy-only claim.

This was my first time participating in Advent of Code. Problems were
easy at first. I solved many of them that first Saturday.
I solved many problems before I ever received a "wrong answer" message.
I solved many problems before I ever defined a function.

-- Problem 24 part 2 was hardest for me.

-- Problem __ (TODO the infinite grid one) was tough, as there were
many little details to worry about.

-- Problem 25 is the one where I had to learn something new
(Karger's algorithm).

TODO hyperlinks to selected problems

If you want to run my scripts, you will need Python.
I used Python 3.10, but any recent Python should work.
You should find the problem statement and problem inputs at the
Advent of Code web site. Record your problem input in a file named
"input.txt" so that my script can find it.

Congratulations to Eric Wastl on creating a nice set of problems
for this competition. The visual presentation is impressive and no
small amount of work.
